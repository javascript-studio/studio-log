# Changes

## 1.4.1

- ✨ Add install instructions

## 1.4.0

- 🍏 Add global log filter stream support

    > A global filter stream can be configured which will receive all log
    > entries before they are passed to the transform stream. This can be used
    > to enrich the log data with generic environment information.

- 🍏 Add support for logger base data

    > When creating a logger, a `data` property can be passed which will be
    > included in the `data` of each log entry.

- 🍏 Add support for child loggers

    > Child loggers have their namespace joined with their parent by a blank
    > and the `data` property of the parent and the child logger are merged.

- 🍏 Add `mute()` to logger instance
- 🐛 Do not invoke filters if out stream was removed

## 1.3.0

- 🍏 Add log instance filter stream support

    > Filters are object streams to modify the log data before passing it to
    > the transform stream. They can be used to x-out confidential information
    > or add generated information to log entries.

- ✨ Add npm 5 `package-lock.json`

## 1.2.0

The ndjson parsing and serialization was refactored into [a separate
module][studio-ndjson]. This enables error handling for serialization failures.

- 🍏 Use the [Studio ndjson][studio-ndjson] parser transform
- 🍏 Handle transform error events. If a transform error occurs, an error
  message is logged instead of throwing up the stack.
- 🍏 Replace the internal default transform with the more robust implementation
  from [Studio ndjson][studio-ndjson].
- ✨ Make log functions no-ops if no output is given. This avoids pointless
  `JSON.stringify` invocations and therefore improves performance a tiny bit.

🐛 Fix screenshot image to work outside of GitHub

## 1.1.0

🍏 Add `hasStream()` to the API which returns whether an output stream was set.
