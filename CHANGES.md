# Changes

## 1.2.0

The ndjson parsing and serialization was refactored into [a separate
module][studio-ndjson]. This enables error handling for serialization failures.

- 🍏 Use the [Studio ndjson][studio-ndjson] parser transform
- 🍏 Handle transform error events. If a transform error occurs, an error
  message is logged instead of throwing up the stack.
- 🍏 Replace the internal default transform with the more robust implementation
  from [Studio ndjson][studio-ndjson].
- ✨ Make log functions no-ops if no output is given. This avoids pointless
  `JSON.stringify` invocations and therefore improves performance a tiny bit.

## 1.1.0

🍏 Add `hasStream()` to the API which returns whether an output stream was set.
